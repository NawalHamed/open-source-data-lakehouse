# 🚀 Building a Modern Data Lakehouse  

This project demonstrates how to build a **modern data lakehouse architecture** using open-source technologies.  
It provides a **hands-on example** of integrating different components to create a **scalable, flexible, and efficient data platform** capable of handling diverse workloads—from raw data ingestion to advanced analytics and visualization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

This lakehouse architecture leverages the following key open-source tools:  

- **MinIO** → High-performance, S3-compatible object storage serving as the data lake layer for raw and processed data.  
- **Apache Spark** → Unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing and transformation.  
- **Apache Iceberg** → Open table format providing ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel for datasets.  
- **Project Nessie** → Git-like data catalog for Iceberg tables, supporting branching, merging, and version control.  
- **Apache Airflow** → Workflow orchestration platform for scheduling and managing data pipelines.  
- **Apache Superset** → Data exploration and visualization platform for building dashboards and reports.

## ✨ Features  

- **📦 Scalable Data Storage** → Object storage with MinIO.  
- **🕒 Data Versioning & Governance** → Iceberg + Nessie for schema evolution, ACID transactions, and auditability.  
- **⚡ ETL/ELT Workflows** → Spark transformations orchestrated with Airflow.  
- **📋 Workflow Orchestration** → Airflow ensures pipeline reliability and data freshness.  
- **📊 Business Intelligence** → Superset provides rich dashboards and insights on top of Iceberg tables.  
- **🧩 Modular Design** → All components are containerized for easy deployment and management.

## 🔄 Data Flow  

1. **Data Ingestion** → Raw data is ingested into MinIO.  
2. **Data Transformation** → Spark jobs read, process, and write data as Iceberg tables, managed by Nessie.  
3. **Data Analysis** → Superset connects to Iceberg/Nessie to power visualizations and dashboards.
